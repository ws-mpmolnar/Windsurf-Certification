# Windsurf Administrator Guide

This guide provides high-level information for administrators about additional features of the Windsurf for use in their organization.

## MCP Servers

The Windsurf Editor supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, which extend the capabilities of the AI assistant by providing access to tools and resources beyond the IDE.

### Key Features for Administrators

- **Access Control**: Admins may control which MCP server configurations users or teams have access to. See [Admin Controls](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp#admin-controls-teams-%26-enterprises) for more details.
- **Custom MCP Server Management**: Administrators can configure, deploy, and maintain custom MCP servers to extend Windsurf's functionality. This is outside the scope of Windsurf.

## Analytics API

Windsurf provides a comprehensive Analytics API that allows administrators to consume usage data and integrate it with your preferred analytics systems.
