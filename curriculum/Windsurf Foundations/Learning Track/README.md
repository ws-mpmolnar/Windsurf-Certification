# Windsurf Editor Modalities

> **Note**: This walkthrough is intended for the Windsurf Editor. If you are using the Windsurf Plugins/Extensions, your Windsurf Tab and Cascade experience may vary.

Windsurf provides three primary modalities for AI-assisted development. First time in Windsurf? Explore the modalities below for hands-on examples and real user flows. 

For full documentation on Windsurf's capabilities, see the [Windsurf Documentation](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/getting-started)
## Primary Walkthroughs - Windsurf Capabilities
### 1. [Windsurf Cascade](./cascade.md)

Explore Cascade to experience Windsurf's collaborative, agentic experience. 
#### Key Takeaways:
In this walkthrough, you’ll see how Cascade can help you:
- Plan and execute complex programming tasks with ease
- Turn multi-step workflows into simple, customizable prompts
- Effortlessly pull context from across your workspace right when you need it


### 2. [Windsurf Command](./command.md)

Explore Command to experience a fast, inline AI-powered code assistant.
#### Key Takeaways:
In this walkthrough, you’ll see how Command can help you:
- Instantly edit and refactor code directly in the editor
- Generate proper CLI syntax in the terminal using natural language


### 3. [Windsurf Tab](./windsurf-tab.md)

Explore Tab to accelerate your coding with intelligent, context-aware autocompletions.
#### Key Takeaways:
In this walkthrough, you’ll see how Tab can help you:
- Accept completions and automate repetitive code patterns with a single keystroke
- Effortlessly jump between code sections using next-intent prediction
- Generate suggestions before, after, and between lines of code


### Quickstart the Windsurf Capabilities

1. **Cascade**: Open the Cascade chat window (`Command + L`), and start typing your task or click the `Chat` button when you select code
2. **Command**: Use `Command + I` or click the `Edit` button that appears when selecting code
3. **Tab**: Look for tab indicators while coding and press `Tab` to accept suggestions. `Command + arrow` allows you to accept one word at a time for autocomplete suggestions

## Additional Walkthroughs
Once you've explored the core Windsurf modalities, you can look at [Common Use Cases](./common-use-cases.md), which provide some suggested flows based on the scope of your task at hand.

Alternatively, [Challenges](./challenges/README.md) provide some open-ended tasks for you to continue exploring Windsurf.

We also have provided a [for Administrators](./for-administrators) document to point you to references for key administrative features.
