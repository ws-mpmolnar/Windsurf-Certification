# Windsurf Foundations

Welcome to the Windsurf Foundations course! This section includes a sample code base and suggested flows (prompts + user actions) as you get hands-on with the Windsurf Editor.

Instead of providing an exhaustive demonstration of all Windsurf's capabilities as your AI coding assistant, this project focuses on a few representative user flows and key takeaways for working with Windsurf.

For the latest information on Windsurf, check out [Windsurf University](https://windsurf.com/university) and the [Windsurf Documentation](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/getting-started)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You will need to:
- Install the [Windsurf Editor](https://windsurf.com/download)
- Clone this repository
![Clone Repository](walkthrough/assets/clone.gif)
- Run the `/initialize-dev-environment` workflow in Cascade to setup your local development environment

### Introductory Tutorials
Begin by working through the [Learning Track](curriculum/1. Windsurf Foundations/1. Learning Track) to explore sample flows that demonstrate how to effectively collaborate with your AI coding assistant. 

While these files are available on your local machine, it is recommended you open them in Github for better readability.

### Disclaimer on Non-deterministic Behavior

While your specific interactions with Windsurf may vary, the goal is to demonstrate how Windsurf helps you stay in the flow so you can dream bigger.
