# Windsurf Walkthrough

Welcome to the Windsurf Walkthrough! This project includes a sample code base and suggested flows (prompts + user actions) as you get hands-on with the Windsurf Editor.

Instead of providing an exhaustive demonstration of all Windsurf's capabilities as your AI coding assistant, this project focuses on a few representative user flows and key takeaways for working with Windsurf.

For the latest information on Windsurf, check out [Windsurf University](https://windsurf.com/university) and the [Windsurf Documentation](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/getting-started)

### Introductory Tutorials
Begin by working through the [walkthrough](./walkthrough) to explore sample flows that demonstrate how to effectively collaborate with your AI coding assistant. 

While these files are available on your local machine, it is recommended you open them in Github for better readability.
