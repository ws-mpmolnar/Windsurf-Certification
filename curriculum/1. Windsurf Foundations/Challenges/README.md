# Windsurf Challenges

Now that you've learned the basics of Windsurf's capabilities (Cascade, Command, and Tab), you should continue to learn and explore!

Below are some sample challenges/open-ended tasks that give you an opportunity to see how you would work with Windsurf to accomplish your task.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Windsurf's capabilities (Cascade, Command, and Tab)
- Familiarity with the `contact-form-app` application structure
- Basic understanding of React and Python

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Code Quality Enhancement

**Objective:** Improve code quality across the application.

#### Ideas to Explore:

1. **Refactor Utility Functions**
   - The `ContactForm.tsx` component contains utility functions that should be moved to a more appropriate location
   - Consider how to best organize these functions for reusability

2. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Explore ways to add comprehensive documentation to the codebase
   - Pay special attention to regex patterns and ensure they follow best practices

3. **Standardize Code Patterns**
   - Identify inconsistent patterns in error handling and validation
   - Implement a more consistent approach throughout the application

### Challenge 2: Feature Enhancement

**Objective:** Add new features to the contact form application.

#### Ideas to Explore:

1. **Add New Form Fields**
   - Extend the contact form with additional fields (phone, address, etc.)
   - Consider the full stack implications of your changes

2. **Improve User Feedback**
   - The current form lacks meaningful feedback after submission
   - Implement a notification system that communicates success and failure states

3. **Create a Contacts Dashboard**
   - Design and implement a view to display submitted contact information
   - Think about how to organize and present the data effectively

### Challenge 3: Testing and Debugging

**Objective:** Strengthen the application's reliability through testing and debugging.

#### Ideas to Explore:

1. **Test Coverage**
   - The application lacks comprehensive tests
   - Develop a testing strategy that covers critical functionality

2. **Debugging Practice**
   - Introduce (or find) a bug in the application
   - Use Windsurf's capabilities to diagnose and fix the issue

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Identify potential performance bottlenecks in the application
   - Implement optimizations to improve user experience

### Challenge 4: Windsurf Customization

**Objective:** Tailor Windsurf to your development workflow.

#### Ideas to Explore:

1. **Custom Workflows**
   - Design a workflow that addresses a repetitive task in your development process
   - Implement and test your workflow

2. **Custom Rules**
   - Create rules that enforce your preferred coding standards
   - Apply these rules to improve code quality

3. **Multi-tool Integration**
   - Experiment with combining browser preview, terminal commands, and code editing
   - Create a seamless workflow between these different capabilities

## Advanced Explorations

For those seeking greater challenges:

1. **Full-Stack Feature**
   - Implement a contact categorization and filtering system
   - Consider how to structure data, update the API, and create an intuitive UI

2. **Architecture Refactoring**
   - Evaluate the current application architecture
   - Implement a more scalable approach (state management, component structure, etc.)

3. **Deployment and CI/CD**
   - Set up a deployment pipeline for the application
   - Implement automated testing as part of the deployment process

## Experimentation Tips

1. **Mix and Match Modalities**
   - Don't limit yourself to a single Windsurf modality
   - Experiment with different combinations to find what works best for each task

2. **Context is Key**
   - Provide Windsurf with relevant context for better results
   - Try different ways of framing your requests

3. **Iterative Approach**
   - Start with broader requests and refine based on results
   - Use what you learn to inform your next interaction

## Workshop Reflection

As you work through these challenges, consider:

- Which modalities were most effective for different types of tasks?
- How did combining modalities improve your workflow?
- What strategies produced the best results when working with Windsurf?

Remember that working with Windsurf is a continuous learning experience. The skills you develop in this workshop will help you adapt to new capabilities as they emerge in the product and form an intuitive understanding of how to collaborate with Windsurf
